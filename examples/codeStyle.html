            keys and their short 1.2mm actuation point was par excellence, and the RGB lighting gave me faint Candy Land
            vibes with its bright colors. However, while it was good for typing and many games, configuration fanatics were
            left out of the fun by the lack of dedicated macro keys. This month, Corsair finally added MX Speed keys to its
            flagship K95 model, but that's not the only upgrade gamers and typists will discover. The $200 K95 RGB Platinum
            features some redesigned buttons, a reversible wrist rest and a snazzy lighting bar. It's more of a refinement
            than a revamp, but it's one that makes the new K95 a flashy, yet somehow tasteful, addition to any desk. Yes,
            even with the colors.`;
